# Shape-Recognition-Neural-network-with-backpropagation-algorithm
Backpropagation algorithm is well known of training artificial neural Networks in conjunction with an optimization method. This method calculate the weights of the Network with the loss function, is one of the most popular algorithm in neural networks. Rojas [2005] claimed that BP algorithm could be broken down to four main steps. After choosing the weights of the network randomly, the back propagation algorithm is used to compute the necessary corrections. The algorithm can be decomposed in the following four steps:
 Feed-forward computation
 Back propagation to the output layer
 Back propagation to the hidden layer
 Weight updates
The algorithm is stopped when the value of the error function has become sufficiently small.
This is very rough and basic formula for BP algorithm. There are some variation proposed by other scientist but Rojas definition seem to be quite accurate and easy to follow. The last step, weight update is happening throughout the algorithm
